* I am currently pursuing my Master of Science (Computer Science) at the [University of Melbourne](https://www.unimelb.edu.au), Australia.
* I completed my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE), with an honours in Natural Language Processing (NLP), at [IIIT-Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), India.
* As part of my honours, I worked with [Dr. Manish Shrivastava](https://www.iiit.ac.in/people/faculty/m.shrivastava/) in the MT-NLP lab of [Language Technologies Research Centre (LTRC)](https://ltrc.iiit.ac.in), on Neural Machine Translation (NMT) for South Indian languages, with a focus on techniques to tackle low-resource languages.
* Last summer, I interned at the [Institute of Formal and Applied Linguistics (UFAL)](http://ufal.mff.cuni.cz), Charles University in Prague, where I worked with [Dr. Ondrej Bojar](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=G_65vFsAAAAJ) on Multi-Modal Machine Translation, and explored novel approaches to the Word Sense Disambiguation (WSD) problem as well.
* During the summer of 2017, I interned with the [Arabic Language Technologies (ALT) Group](http://alt.qcri.org) at the [Qatar Computing Research Institute (QCRI)](https://www.qcri.org/) in Doha. I worked with [Dr. Preslav Nakov](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=DfXsKZ4AAAAJ) and [Dr. Hassan Sajjad](https://scholar.google.co.in/citations?hl=en&user=t3BH6NkAAAAJ) on building an Alexa skill to enable question-answering capabilities for the Amazon Echo device, based on nearly 1 million Q&A pairs extracted from the [Qatar Living](www.qatarliving.com) website.
* My research interests lie in the field of machine learning, particularly natural language processing.  
* My hobbies include reading fiction, watching movies, and playing badminton.
